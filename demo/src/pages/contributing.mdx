# Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome. If you are looking to make a contribution, follow the steps outlined below.

## Branch Organization

All pull requests should point directly to the `main` branch. There are no development or release branches for simplicity.

## Bugs

If you have a bug you'd like to file, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/KevinElberger/react-spotify-muse/issues).
Prior to this, you should check the open issues to make sure your issue does not exist already.

<br />

The best way to have your bug fixed as soon as possible is to provide a test case as a starting point.

## Change Proposals

In the spirit of open source, change proposals are welcome as well. If you have a suggestion that could affect the public API or is significant in other ways, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/KevinElberger/react-spotify-muse/issues).
From here we'll be able to discuss the proposal before people decide to work on it.

## Opening A Pull request

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure you do the following:

1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/KevinElberger/react-spotify-muse) and create your branch from `main`.
2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.
3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, please add tests.
4. Ensure the test suite passes by running `yarn test`. Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.

If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on a fix.
If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people don’t accidentally duplicate your effort.

<br />

If somebody claims an issue but doesn’t follow up for more than two weeks, it’s fine to take it over but you should still leave a comment.
