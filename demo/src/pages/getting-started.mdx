# Getting Started

React Spotify Muse is a simple and straightforward component to show others what you're currently listening to on Spotify.

## Quick Start

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<SyntaxHighlighter language="bash" style={vscDarkPlus}>{installation}</SyntaxHighlighter>

In order to display the currently playing track from Spotify, you'll need a Spotify OAuth web API token.
If you're unfamiliar with how to get a token, follow Spotify's <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/" target="_blank">Authorization Guide</a>.

<br />

> Keep in mind that the OAuth tokens do expire after a period of time. It will be up to you to keep the token refreshed.

<br />

After installing the package, import the `NowPlaying` component into your app.

<br />

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<SyntaxHighlighter language="jsx" style={vscDarkPlus}>{basicUsage}</SyntaxHighlighter>

Voila! You should now be seeing what is currently being listened to on the account that's associated with the Spotify OAuth token.
